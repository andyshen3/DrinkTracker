# DrinkTracker

### Background
Underage Drinking is a big issue impacting our society today. Excessive drinking is the cause for over 4,000 deaths among youth under the age of 21 each year. According to cdc.gov, "people aged 12 to 20 years drink 11% of all alcohol consumed in the United States. More than 90% of this alcohol is consumed in the form of binge drinks". 

Monitoring and preventing underage drinking is a near impossible task, so an alternative course of action could be to provide alcohol consumers with a way to keep track of their alcohol intake and drink more responsibly. This is the motivation behind DrinkTracker - to provide an app that helps people monitor their current state and notifies them when they have had too much to drink.

### What does DrinkTracker do?
DrinkTracker helps users monitor their alcohol consumption. The app calculates the recommended number of standard drinks that a user should have based off of their gender and weight (in terms of BAC), and provides the user with a status page about the number of drinks consumed and time that has elapsed. In the case that the user exceeded the recommended drinking amount, a warning will appear on the app, reminding the user to stop alcohol consumption and to drink water.
